        <h2 class="heading-2">Description</h2>
        <p>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with some sort of liquid.
            In the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine.
            Braising is similar to stewing, but it requires less liquid.</p>
